# Overview

This repository is one deployment of Airflow, a data orchestration tool, from the official `apache/airflow` image in Docker with reporting dashboards setup in Grafana. To configure Airflow metrics to be usable in Grafana, the following tools are also used: StatsD, StatsD-Exporter, and Prometheus. The setup is described below. Associated blog post [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/airflow-in-docker-metrics-reporting-83ad017a24eb).

Additionally, this repository showcases an example of a scalable DAG folder and code architecture, discussed in my Airflow Summit 2021 talk, `Writing Dry Code in Airflow`.

Now, you may ask, what's the motivation for monitoring Airflow with external resources, instead of using the UI? I answer a question with a question: how would you be notified if the scheduler queue was filled and no tasks were executing, or the scheduler went down? Without this architecture, notifications of that kind would not be intuitative to setup.

# Architecture: Monitoring

All of the services are run as separate containers, with Airflow using multiple containers (described below).

The resources are located at the following URLs:
- Airflow Webserver UI: http://localhost:8080
- StatsD Metrics list: http://localhost:9123/metrics
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: 
    - URL: http://localhost:3000
        - Login: username = admin, password = password
    - Dashboards: http://localhost:3000/dashboards
    - Datasources: http://localhost:3000/datasources

## Airflow:

### Official Image

The Airflow containers are built using the official `apache/airflow` Docker image, version 2.0.0. This contains significant updates when compared to the `puckel/docker-airflow` image. This repository can be compared to the `puckel/docker-airflow` repository to indicate changes needed to migrate to the official image, but the main differences are also outlined below.

### Containers

There are several Airflow containers including Redis, Postgres, the Webserver, and the Scheduler. On the webserver and scheduler, a sample DAG is loaded from the `dags/` folder. The current deployment uses the CeleryExecutor; the metrics have not been tested with the KubernetesExecutor.

### StatsD

Airflow emits metrics in the StatsD format automatically, if certain environment variables (starting with `AIRFLOW__SCHEDULER__STATSD_`) are set. More information on StatsD found [here](https://github.com/statsd/statsd).

## StatsD-Exporter

The StatsD-Exporter container converts Airflow's metrics in StatsD format to Prometheus format, the datasource for Grafana. More information on StatsD-Exporter found [here](https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter).

## Prometheus

Prometheus is a service commonly used for time-series data reporting. It is particularly convenient when using Grafana as a reporting UI since Prometheus is a supported datasource. More information on Prometheus found [here](https://prometheus.io/).

## Grafana

### UI

Grafana is a reporting UI layer that is often used to connect to non-relational databases. In this exercise, Grafana uses Prometheus as a datasource for building dashboards.

### Provisioning

The current deployment leverages provisioning, which uses code to define datasources, dashboards, and notifiers in Grafana upon startup (more information [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/)). The Prometheus datasource is already provisioned, as well as an `Airflow Metrics` dashboard tracking the number of running and queued tasks over time. The datasources, dashboards, and `prometheus.yml` configuration file are mounted as volumes on the container.

# Running the Containers

## Requirements:
- Docker
- docker-compose
- Python3
- Git

## Steps

The following steps are to be run in a terminal:
```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rover0811/airflow-docker-metrics.git

# Navigate to the cloned folder
cd airflow-docker-metrics


# Save docker images for closed network
./save_docker_image.ps1

# If ps1 file cannot excutable by security policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

# If you want to start up the containers in closed network
docker load -i [filename].tar
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

# Notes
# a generic admin user is created when bringing up the containers. Username is `admin` and password is `password`.
```


## The Result

An `Airflow Metrics` dashboard has been provisioned in Grafana in this repository:

![Architecture](.//documentation/grafana_dashboard.png)

There are many more useful StatsD metrics made available, such as DAG and task duration. These can all be leveraged to create more dashboards.

## Deployment

The repository has been run locally, but can be deployed to any instance on GCP or AWS. SSHing onto the instance will allow the user to pull the repository, install the requirements, and start the Docker containers.

GCP Cloud Composer is a hosted Airflow deployment, however the configuration is not exposed. Capturing StatsD metrics may not be straight forward with that approach. This repository is a guide for a self-managed Airflow deployment; other hosted options for Airflow (such as Astronomer) exist.

# Technical Notes

## Transitioning to the Official Airflow Image

The primary steps taken to transition from the puckel/docker-airflow to the apache/airflow image are:
- The `airflow initdb` to initialize Airflow's backend database is run as a command when bringing up the webserver container, declared in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- If using the CeleryExecutor, variables needed should be defined as ENV variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Future Improvements

Ways to improve the current architecture include:
- Not running a `sleep` command in the scheduler to wait for the `db init` command in the `webserver` to complete.
- Bugfixes: sometimes DAGs don't update in the UI, and don't show any errors. Cause is unknown.
